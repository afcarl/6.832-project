6.832-project
=============

This repository contains the code for trajectory optimization for underactuated systems via TrajOpt [1], an approach based on sequential convex optimization (SCO). SCO solves non-convex problems by solving a local approximated convex sub-problem iteratively. We implemented the algorithm using a matlab-based convex optimizer CVX [2,3] for the sub-problem within the framework of Drake [4]. Different dynamics constraints were considered including forward Euler (trajopt_forward.m), backward Euler (trajopt_backward.m), mid-point Euler (trajopt_midpoint.m), and collocation constraints (trajopt_collocation.m).

The simulation results are partially available here http://people.csail.mit.edu/ziw/6.832/.

To run the matlab files, Drake [4] and CVX [3] are required to be installed. An example showing how to run trajectory optimization with our code is shown in run_nlink.m. run_nlink.m should be put into the directory in drake, drake/examples/PlanarNLink/.
